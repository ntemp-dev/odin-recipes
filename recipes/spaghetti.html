            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to <em>350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</em></li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 to 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
                    <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a bowl and mix in spaghetti sauce.</li>
                    <li>Place 1/2 of the butter slices into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Spread 1/2 of the spaghetti into the dish.</li>
                    <li>Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl; spread mixture over spaghetti.</li>
                    <li>Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in an even layer.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese on top and continue baking <em>until cheese has melted and is lightly browned,</em> about 15 minutes more.</li>
                </ol>
